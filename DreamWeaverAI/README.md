# DreamWeaver AI

This is a minimal React Native prototype built with Expo. It includes:

- Stack navigation (Home, Entry, Dictionary)
- Zustand for simple state management
- Placeholder screens for future dream logging and interpretation features

This skeleton can be expanded with Firebase integration, AI calls, secure storage, and other functionality as described in the SDD.
