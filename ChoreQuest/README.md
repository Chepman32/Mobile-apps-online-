# ChoreQuest

This is a minimal React Native Expo skeleton for the **ChoreQuest** app idea. It sets up basic navigation and state management using Zustand. Screens are placeholders ready to be expanded.

## Running

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

This will start the Expo development server so you can run the app on a simulator or device.
