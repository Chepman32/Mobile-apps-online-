# Recall

Minimal Expo prototype for the **Recall** flashcard app. This skeleton includes tab and stack navigation with Zustand for simple state. Screens are placeholders for decks, review sessions, statistics, and settings.

Use this as a starting point to implement the spaced repetition algorithm, note editor, and AI integration.
