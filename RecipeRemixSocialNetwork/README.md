# Recipe Remix Social Network

This is a minimal skeleton React Native app using Expo. It demonstrates a basic social recipe feed where users can create and remix recipes.

The project includes:

- Stack navigation with five placeholder screens (Feed, Create, Profile, Search, Shop).
- Redux Toolkit for simple recipe state management.
- Placeholder components like `RecipeCard` and `RemixEditor`.

Heavy features such as Firebase integration, image uploads, and real-time collaboration are left as future work.
