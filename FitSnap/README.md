# FitSnap

A minimal React Native skeleton for the **FitSnap** app. The goal is to provide a starting point for AI-guided micro-workouts with a simple navigation structure and Zustand state store.

## Screens
- Onboarding
- Dashboard
- Workout
- History
- Leaderboard
- Store
- Settings

All advanced functionality like camera rep counting and Supabase backend are left as future improvements.
