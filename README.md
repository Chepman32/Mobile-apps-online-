# Mobile Apps Collection

This repository contains sample React Native implementations inspired by various app ideas.

Available samples:

- **Habit Tracker with AI Coach** (`HabitTrackerAICoach/`) – basic habit tracker with Redux store and placeholder screens.
- **Fit Craft** (`FitCraft/`) – navigation and theme example with zustand.
- **Recipe Remix Social Network** (`RecipeRemixSocialNetwork/`) – skeleton social recipe app with Redux and placeholder components.

Each project uses Expo and minimal state management. Heavy features like Firebase integration or backend services are left as future improvements.
