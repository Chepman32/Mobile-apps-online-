# Mobile Apps Collection

This repository contains sample React Native implementations inspired by various app ideas. Currently included projects:

- **HabitTrackerAICoach/** – basic habit tracker with AI coach chat and progress chart.
- **FitCraft/** – minimal skeleton app with navigation and zustand store.
- **MoodTrackerJournal/** – starter mood tracking journal with emoji picker and insights chart.

Each project uses Expo and Redux or Zustand for state management. Additional apps can be added following a similar structure.
