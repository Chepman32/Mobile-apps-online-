# Mobile Apps Collection

This repository provides minimal React Native prototypes for various app ideas. Each project uses Expo and a simple state management approach.

Current examples:

- **FitCraft** – skeleton app demonstrating bottom tab navigation and zustand.
- **HabitTrackerAICoach** – sample habit tracker using Redux Toolkit.
- **DreamWeaverAI** – basic stack navigation setup for dream journaling features.

These prototypes can be expanded with Firebase, AI integrations, and additional screens as described in their respective README files.
