# Mobile Apps Collection

This repository contains sample React Native implementations inspired by various app ideas. Projects include:

- **FitCraft** – a minimal Expo skeleton with tab navigation using Zustand.
- **Habit Tracker with AI Coach** – a basic habit tracker using Redux.
- **Budget Buddy** – a lightweight budget tracker using Zustand.

Each project uses Expo and demonstrates simple navigation and state management. Additional apps can be added following a similar structure.
