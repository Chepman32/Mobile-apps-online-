# Fit Craft

This is a minimal skeleton React Native app using Expo. It demonstrates:

- Bottom tab navigation
- Light/dark theme support
- Placeholder screens: Map, Splash, Detail, Create/Edit, Purchase, Onboarding
- zustand for state management

All heavy features like Firebase integration, AR, audio/video, payments, and Lottie animations are left as placeholders for further implementation.
