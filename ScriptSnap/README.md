# ScriptSnap

This is a minimal React Native skeleton for the **ScriptSnap** app idea. The app allows users to photograph handwritten notes and convert them into structured markdown.

The project uses **Expo** with React Navigation and Zustand for state management. Screens are placeholders ready for further implementation.

## Available Screens
- Camera
- Parse Preview
- Editor
- Export Picker
- History

Run `npm install` then `npm start` to launch with Expo.
