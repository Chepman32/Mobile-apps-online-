# Mood Tracker Journal

A simple React Native app built with Expo for logging daily moods. It features:

- Emoji-based mood picker
- Journal history list
- Insights chart using `react-native-chart-kit`
- Redux Toolkit for state management

Screens are wired with React Navigation. This is a lightweight starter without backend integration.
