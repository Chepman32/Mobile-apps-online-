# MindMapr Live

This folder contains a minimal React Native (Expo) skeleton for the **MindMapr Live** idea. It includes placeholder screens and Zustand state management so you can extend it into a full collaborative mind‑mapping tool.

## Available Screens
- **Dashboard** – list of maps
- **Map Canvas** – basic canvas with node placeholders
- **History** – revision timeline
- **Settings** – user preferences

Additional components like the idea suggestion drawer and share modal are represented as placeholders within the canvas screen.
